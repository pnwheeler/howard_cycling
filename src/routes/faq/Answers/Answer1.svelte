    The Maryland Interscholastic Cycling League began in 2017 as part of the nation-wide National Interscholastic Cycling Association.  
    The Maryland Cycling League provides a fun, safe and high-quality mountain biking program for students in grades 6 to 12. 
    With the cooperation of our partners and our sponsors, we provide a competitive mountain bike youth racing experience.   
    The League promotes the core values of Equality, Inclusivity, Strong body, Strong Mind, and Strong Character.  
    We take “all comers” in our league; no experience necessary!
