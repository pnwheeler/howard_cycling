    Not quite sure? We get that. Bring your bike to practice and give it a try! Riders are welcome to sign 
    a waiver and join us for one practice before needing to register.  Please fill out the
    <a href="https://nationalmtb.org/agreement-to-participate-and-release-of-liability-form/" target="_blank">NICA waiver</a>, 
    and bring it with you when you join us for one practice.  If you use the NICA electronic waiver form, 
    please email it to <a href="href=mailto:howardcyclingclub@gmail.com">howardcyclingclub@gmail.com</a>.  
    Howard Cycling Club will staff a rider registration table during events to speak with riders and parents 
    and to receive appropriate documentation.  Upon request, new 2021 riders will also receive the Pit Zone registration link.
