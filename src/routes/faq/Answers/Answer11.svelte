    â€‹Maryland Interscholastic Cycling League rules state that athletes must be enrolled in middle school (grades 6-8), 
    or the homeschool equivalent, and be no younger than 10 during the entire school year.  
    We interpret that rule to include any child that will be rising into the 6th grade during the fall race season, 
    and that is also at least 10 years old.
