    The Maryland Interscholastic Cycling League rules state that to be eligible to compete in either a spring 
    or fall school-year season, a student-athlete must be no older than 19 years of age at any time during the 
    entire school year; and not have a high school diploma, general education diploma (GED), or otherwise be 
    graduated from high school.
