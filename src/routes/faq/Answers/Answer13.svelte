    The MLCC developed operating procedures for team supported events including practices, races, rides, and 
    other gatherings.  The MLCC will apply NICA, MICL, federal, state, county, and local regulations, and best 
    practices to ensure the safety of riders, coaches, and parents at all times.   Additional details are on
