    Pre-Season normally starts in April and runs through June.   Check the events page for more information.  
    Practice starts in earnest on July 1.  The 2022 season will likely run until November.  This is a club sport in the sense 
    that nobody gets cut from the team, and we don't have tryouts.  While we are a club sport and practices are not mandatory, 
    we like to see kids practicing with us at least twice a week - and the more they ride the better experience they will have 
    come race day and the better their cardio endurance will be.  As a registered rider you paid for the races.  Each student 
    athlete who wants to race can.  A student athlete who does not want to race is not required.  We focus on <strong>FUN</strong>. We will teach 
    trail riding skills, and will likely get to travel to some really cool trails to ride.
