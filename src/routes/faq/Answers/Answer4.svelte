    Student Athletes can compete in “off-road” race events held on dirt trails known as “single track.” 
    The trails are often dual-use hiking trails.  Many refer to this sport as “mountain biking,” but there are no mountains in these events.  
    However, we will design each race to challenge athletes mentally and physically.  
    Top finishers earn points for their team, and can accrue points for themselves as well.  
    We encourage everyone to ride in the races (because it’s fun!), but nobody MUST race if they don’t want to.   
    We practice to have fun and work with student athletes on bettering skills on the bike.  
    We work with everyone whether they want to race or just have fun.  
    Student athletes will set goals for the season based on their needs and readiness while re-evaluating those goals throughout the season.
