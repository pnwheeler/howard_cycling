        <h3>No-Contact Rider Registration</h3>
        <p>
            Returning riders can register via the TeamApp link provided by email and can complete all
            necessary documents via the online process. New riders for the 2023 season that would like to
            take advantage of the one-time “Try it Out” practice should complete the online waiver found on
            the <a href="https://nationalmtb.org/agreement-to-participate-and-release-of-liability-form/" target="_blank">NICA website</a>and
            bring a signed copy with them. The club will staff a rider registration table
            during events to speak with riders and parents and to receive appropriate documentation.
